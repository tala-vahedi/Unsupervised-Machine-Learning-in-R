# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-in-R

Unsupervised machine learning algorithms perform descriptive tasks in order to analyze and describe big data quickly. The k-means clustering algorithm, as well as Self Organizing Maps (SOM) algorithms are created in R in order to visually map and describe big data at a large scale.
